# iBootLSD
A dumb script that endlessly loops bgcolor to make your device show "rainbows" in recovery.

# Compatibility
This script has been tested to work on iPhone SE (1st generation) through iPhone 7 Plus.

i don't know if this script works on any other devices, feel free to play with it.

# How to use
1. Put your device into DFU mode
2. Upload a signed iBSS/iBEC to your device using [libirecovery](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libirecovery)
3. Run the script `./iBootLSD.sh` (or doubleclick iBootLSD.bat on Windows).
4. Pretty!!!!
